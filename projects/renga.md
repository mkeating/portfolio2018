‘Renga’ is an old form of Japanese poetry where an unending poem is written on a single scroll by multiple authors. This app is an attempt to replicate that experience. Write your lines of poetry onto the digital scroll, and you’ll see others’ lines appearing in real time. Renga is the basis for Haiku poetry, so if a haiku is created on the scroll, it will be added to the archive.
