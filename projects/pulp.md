Pulp is an older app; it was my capstone project for my master’s at Harvard Extension. The idea was to create a classroom tool for creating branching, choice-based narratives. If you’ve read a Choose Your Own Adventure book, you’ll know what Pulp is designed to build. In addition, I wanted to have a collaborative, classroom-based approach, so new branches created by your classmates appear on your screen in real-time. Branches can be explicit (“Enter the cave” or “Turn back and return to camp”) or more implicit or impressionist; each individual word in a story chunk can become a link to a new node. I built Pulp after I became fascinated with real-time apps but before I learned React, so I definitely plan to rebuild it with more modern tools soon.
