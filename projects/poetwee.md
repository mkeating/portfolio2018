Taking inspiration from refrigerator magnets, I wanted to make a poetry builder that provides the user with some building blocks while still giving them some control over the finished product. Twitter provides functionally infinite material, so I built Poetwee on their API. The user inputs a multi-word phrase (For example, “Once more unto the breach”), and Poetwee will return 10 tweets that contain the word “once,” ten tweets that contain the word “more”, etc. The user then can use a swipe interface to choose which lines will make up their poem.
