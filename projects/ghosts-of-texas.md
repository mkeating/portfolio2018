Ghosts is a web-scraper and Twitter bot that tweets the last words of those killed on death row in the state of Texas. http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/ keeps records on inmates, including their offenses, sentences, and, if applicable, last words and last meals. I wrote a small script that crawls the tables on this site and tweets out last words at random. Some are sad, some are funny, some are angry and some are hopeful. I found it to be a really captivating and human corpus of words and wanted to showcase it. The Twitter account no longer runs and the government site has changed itâ€™s structure, so the scraping will no longer function.
